                        <p>See there, told you that would be easy. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. This is truly an almighty mountain. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. A little happy sunlight shining through there. You can do it. Let's build an almighty mountain. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. Get tough with it, get strong. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We have a fantastic little sky! Now then, let's play. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?</p>

                    <p>Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Brown is such a nice color. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Just beat the devil out of it. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Let's have a little bit of fun today. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. Be brave. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. Don't be bashful drop me a line. It's cold, but it's beautiful. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here.</p>
